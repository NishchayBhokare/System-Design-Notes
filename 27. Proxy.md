**Proxy**:
    - In system design, a **proxy is a piece of software or hardware** that acts as an **intermediary** between a **client and a server**. 
    - A proxy server is a hardware or a piece of software that is placed between a client and an application to provide intermediary services in the communication.
    - Proxy server **provides gateway between the user and internet**.

**Advantages** of proxy:
    1) **Improving security**
        - Proxies can hide the IP address of the client or real server, preventing the server from being directly exposed to the internet or preventing identity of client to getx exposed.
    .
    2) **Enhancing performance**
        - Proxies can split incoming traffic across multiple servers, which helps balance demand and keep any one server from becoming overburdened.
        .
    3) **Managing network traffic**
        -Proxies can control which requests reach the server, blocking or filtering out unwanted traffic.
    .    
    4) **Caching**
        - Proxies can store copies of frequently requested data, which can be delivered quickly from the cache when users ask for it.

**Disadvantages** of using proxies include: 
    1) **Increased complexity**: Adding proxies to the architecture can increase system complexity.
    2) **Single point of failure**: A single proxy can introduce a point of failure.



**Two Types** of proxies:

1) **Forward Proxy**:
    - it **hides the identity of client**. This type of proxy can be **used to protect clients** on an internal network.
    - Forward proxy **sits** in **between of client and internet**.
    - **Use case** of forward proxy is, **Bypassing content filters**, **accessing restricted content**.

A **forwards proxy** is mostly **used for**:
    - **to hides client identity**.
    - **Caching**
    - **Traffic Control**
    - **Logging**
    - **Request/Response Transformation**
    - **Encryption**


2) **Reverse Proxy**:
    - It **hides the identity of server**. This type of proxy can be **used to protect servers**.
    - Reverse proxy **sits** in **between of internet and server**.
    - **Use case** of reversed proxy is, **Load balancing**, **caching**, **SSL/TLS offloading,** **web application firewall**.

A **reverse proxy** is mostly **used for**:
    - **to hides Server identity**.
    - **Caching**
    - **Load Balancing**
    - **DDoS Protection**
    - **Canary Experimentation**
    - **URL/Content Rewriting**

**When to use reverse proxy**:
    - When i **don't want to expose server**.
    - To make **user feel** there is **one server**.
    - Provide **load balancing** for the server.
    - Allows administrators **to swap the backend servers** without disturbing the traffic.
    - **Filter** out some **requests**.
