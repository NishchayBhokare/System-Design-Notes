What is Lamport's logical clock?
    - Lamportâ€™s Logical Clock was created by Leslie Lamport. It is procedure to **determine the order of event occuring**. 
    - **Each process** in the system maintains its own logical clock, which is essentially a **counter** (initially set to zero) that is incremented for each event it experiences.
    - When a process does work, it increments its own clock value by a certain unit (**usually 1**).
    .
    - When a process **receives a message**, it updates its clock to be the **maximum of its own clock** and the **received clock value from the message**, and **then increments it by 1**. This **ensures** that the **receiving process logically happens after the sending process** and any other events that the sender knew about.
