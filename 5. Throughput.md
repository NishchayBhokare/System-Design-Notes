What is Throughput?
    - Throughput is the **number of operations** a system can handle **per unit of time**. or The amound of data transmitted per unit of time.
    - or the volume of work/information flowing through a system.
    - Throughput is measured in **bits per second** i.e. **bps**.
    - In case of **distributed** system Throughput is **high** where as in **monolithic** system throughput is **low**.
    - In distributed system throughput is high because **no limit on resources**. we can **scale horizonatally** as much as we want & due to **Load Balancing** also system has high throughput.


Causes of throughput:
    - If **Latency** is high then throughput will be low.
    - **Protocol overhead**: If the protocols used for message transmission require a lot of back-and-forth communication, the network can be overloaded. 
    - **Congestion**: If many request comes at a time. then also there will be low throughput.
    - **Connection type**: Wired connections typically have higher throughput than wireless connections. 
    - **Bandwidth**: Bandwidth is the maximum capacity of a network connection to transfer data. Higher bandwidth usually enables higher throughput


Improving Throughput.
    - **CDN**
    - **Caching**.
    - **Uses of Distributed System**.
    - **Load Balancing**.
    - **Upgrade System**.



**High throughput is good**
