**Message Based Communication**:
    - Message-based communication is a type of IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanism in which **processes** or threads **communicate with each other by sending messages**. 
    - **Client Sends request** in the form of **messages**.
    - **Receiver receives response** in the form of **messages**.
    - It is async, so **client doesn't need to wait** for process.
    - **here producer is client**, **consumer is receiver** and **Agent is communication channel** between them.
    - **Examples** include **face-to-face communication**, **telephone calls**, **voicemails**, **emails**, etc.
    - **Message based communication achieved** by **Kafka** and **RabbitMQ** tools*.


Advantages:
    1) **Simplicity**: Message-based communication is a simple and straightforward approach to IPC, as messages can be easily sent and received between processes.
    .
    2) **Asynchronous communication**: Message-based communication allows for asynchronous communication, as the sender and receiver do not have to be active at the same time.
    .
    3) **Reliability**: Message-based communication can ensure reliable delivery of messages, as messages can be re-sent until they are received by the receiver.
    .
    4) **Scalability**: Message-based communication can be used to implement large-scale distributed systems, as messages can be routed between multiple computers or networks.


Disadvantages:
    1) **Overhead**: Message-based communication can introduce overhead, as the creation and management of message queues can consume system resources.
    .
    2) **Complexity**: Implementing message-based communication requires careful design and management of message queues, which can be complex and time-consuming.
    .
    3) **Latency**: Message-based communication can introduce latency, as messages may have to wait in the queue until they are received by the receiver.
    .
    4) **Limited data size**: Message-based communication is typically limited in the size of data that can be sent in a message, which can be a disadvantage for some types of applications.
