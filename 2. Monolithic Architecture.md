First what is **ARCHITECTURE**?
    - ARCHITECTURE is **Internal design** details for building the applications.



**MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE.**
    - If all the components and functionalities of a project are **entangled** and **combined** in a **single codebase**, then, it is a Monolithic Architecture.
    - Monolithic Architecture has **Less Complexity** => **Easier to Understand** => **Higher Productivity**.
    - **Monolithic System** can also know as **Centralised System**. (because everything is combined).


**Adavantages** of Monolithic Architecture:
    - When we are just starting, we can adopt this architecture.
    - In Monolithic Architecture, all the modules are present in the **single system**, so they require **fewer network calls** as compared to other architectures.
    - It is comparitively **easier to secure** monolithic architecture. because all codes are present in single codebase.
    - **Integreatoin** testing is **easier**.
    - **Less Confusion**.


**Disadvantages** of Monolithic Architecture.
    - Most imp is **SPOF** (Single Point of Failure) because of this whole system gets down.
    - In Monolithic Architecure, every module is combined in single system, so if there is an error or bug in 
    single module, it can **destroy** the complete system.
    - Whenever a **single module is updated**, the whole system needs to updated to reflect changes to the users. All modules are in single system and are connected to one another, so the whole system needs to be updated.
    - If there is any **change** in a **single** module's programming language or framework, it will affect the entire system. The entire system needs to change because every module **interlinked** and **tightly coupled**.
