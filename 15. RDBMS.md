What is RDBMS?
    - RDBMS stands for **Relational Database Management** Systems. It is a program that allows us to **create, delete, and update a relational database**. 
    - A Relational Database is a database system that stores and retrieves data in a tabular format organized in the form of rows and columns.
    - In RDBMS data is represented **in the form of tables**.
    - The **relationship between two tables** is represented by **foreign keys**.


Advantages:
    1) **No Redundancy & Inconsistency**.
    2) **Data Concurrency** - Locking system is provided by RDBMS to prevent abnormalities from occuring.
    3) **Data Searching** - Built in searching capabilities. (No need of seperate programme as in file system).
    4) **Data Integrity** - Ex. to maintain data integrity numeric columns won't have alphabetic data.
    (There is no process in file based system(DBMS) to check these constraints automatically).
    .
    5) **Fault Tolerance**: Replication of databases provides simultaneous access and helps the system recover in case of disasters, such as power failures or sudden shutdowns.
    .
    6) **Easy to Manage**: Each table can be independently manipulated without affecting others.
    7) **Security**: It is more secure consisting of multiple levels of security. Access of data shared can be limited.

Disadvantages: 
    1) **High Cost and Extensive Hardware & Software Support**: Huge costs and setups are required to make these systems functional.
    2) **Scalability**: In case of addition of more data, servers along with additional power, and memory are required. **Vertical scaling is possible..but it has some limit**. and for **horizontal** shcaling..we need to **relational table on every node for that data**.
    .
    3) **Complexity**: Voluminous data creates complexity in understanding of relations and may lower down the performance.
    4) **Structured Limits**: The fields or columns of a relational database system is enclosed within various limits, which may lead to loss of data.
    5) **Rigid Schema**: If we want to add extra field for particular user..then we cannot do this for one user. because data is in tabular format.
