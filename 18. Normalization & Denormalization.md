**Normalization**
    - **Divides data into multiple tables to reduce redundancy and improve consistency** Normalization is often used when there are many update, delete, and insert operations on the data.
    - **Normalization** is the method used in a **database to reduce the data redundancy** and **data inconsistency** from the table

**Advantages** 
    1) Better data integrity 
    2) Less redundancy 
    3) Easier maintenance 


**Disadvantages**
    1) Can slow down read operations due to multiple table joins. 
    2) Making the relations very large.
    3) Maintaining and updating data is difficult. 
    4) Wastage and inefficient use of resources and disc space. 
    5) Errors are more likely to happen. 



**Denormalization**
    - **Combines data from multiple tables into a single table** to make data retrieval faster.
    - **Denormalization** is often **used when there are many costly join queries** in databases.


**Advantages**: 
    1) Faster read operations 
    2) Simpler queries
    3) Management Convenience.
    4) High data availability.
    5) Reduces number of network calls to fetch data from multiple places. 


**Disadvantages**
    1) More redundancy. (wastage of memory) 
    2) Data inconsistencies 
    3) Harder maintenance 
    4) Expensive inserts and updates 
    5) It increases the complexity.
    6) It will cause slow write operations since we will need to write muliple places due to redundancy.
    
    

- The choice between normalization and denormalization depends on the application's requirements.
- A hybrid approach can also be used, combining **normalized tables for critical data** and **denormalized tables for reporting and analysis**.
