**Redundancy**
    - Redundancy is simply **duplication of nodes** or component so that when node or component fails, the duplicate node is available to service customers.
    - Redundancy in system design **ensures that a system keeps working** even if some **parts fail**
    - By adding backup components or processes, redundancy helps **prevent downtime** and improves reliability. It’s like having a spare tire for your car—when one fails, the backup takes over.


Two Types of Redundancy-
    1) Active Redundancy
        - When **two or more entities** are **performing** the **same task simultaneously**, this is known as active redundancy. To keep things going smoothly, the others step in immediately if one of them is unable to perform the task.
        - Active Redundancy is considered when **each unit is operating/active** and responding to the action. Multiple nodes are connected to load balancer, and each unit reaceives an equal load.
        - Example, Think of a **website with two servers working together**. They both show the website to people. If one server has a problem, the other sever quickly takes over to make sure the website keeps running without any issues.

    2) Passive Redundancy
        - Passive redundancy is similar to **having a backup** that is **inactive until it is required**. It remains silent in the background, just ready to jump in and assist when an issue arises.
        - Passive redundancy is considered when **one node is active/operational** and the **other is not operating**. During the breakdown of active node, the passive node maintains availability by becoming the active node.
        - Example, In computer networks, you can have a **spare or backup router.** The backup doesn’t do any work until main router has a problem. When main one fails, the spare router starts working to keep the network connected



**Replication**
    - It includes **redundancy + synchronization** i.e it Involves the copying of data from one node to another node or the synchronisation of state between nodes.

Types of Replication.
    1) Active replication: Involves processing the **same request at every replica**.
    2) Passive replication: Involves **processing** a request on a **single replica** and then **sending** the result to the **other replicas**. Passive replication considered as **Master slave replication**.
