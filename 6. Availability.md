What is Availability?
    - The ability of system to **remain operational & accessible** to uses in the face of failures, diruptions & maintainance activity.
    - In **Monolithic** Architecture Availablility is comparitively **lesser** than **distributed** system.
    - Fault Tolerance is direclty propertional to Availability.
    - Due to replicas and distributed nature. Distributed sytem is more available than centralised system.


How to increase availability
    - **Replication** -> It includes redundancy + synchronization i.e it Involves the copying of data from one node to another node or the synchronisation of state between nodes.
    .
    - **Distributed System**.
    - **Redundancy** -> Redudancy is duplication of nodes, in case of some of them are failing.
