**Authentication**:
    - It asks Who are You?
    - **Authentication Verifies a user's identity**. For example, a user logs in with a username and password, and the server uses the password to authenticate the user.


**Authorization**:
    - It asks What can you do?
    - **Authorization Determines a user's level of access and grants access based on that level**. For example, once a user is authenticated, **authorization can determine what actions they can perform** or what data they can access. 


Types Of Authentication:
    1) **Basic Authentication(BA)**:
        - **Basic authentication (BA) is a standard method for collecting user credentials**, such as a username and password, to provide access to a network or account.
        - **BA is not considered a secure method** of authentication because the **password is vulnerable and can be cached** in a web browser. 

        How it works
            - BA is an HTTP-based method that **transmits user credentials across a network in an unencrypted**, base64-encoded format.
.
    .
    2) **Token Based Authentication**:
        - Token-based authentication is a security protocol that **uses encrypted tokens to verify a user's identity** and **grant access to resources**.
        - This token will expire after specific time. eg. **Bank Websites**.
.
        How it works
            - Users **log in with their credentials**, the **server verifies the login, and then generates a unique token**. The user's **browser stores the token**, which they can use to **access the website or app without re-entering their credentials**.
.
    .
    3) **OAuth Authentication**:
        - OAuth (Open Authorization) is **an authorization protocol that allows users to grant third-party applications** access to their data without sharing their password.
.
        How it works
            OAuth securely passes user authentications and authorizations between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). For example, Microsoft Active Directory and Azure are IdPs, while Salesforce and other customer relationship (CRM) solutions are SPs. 
        .
        Benefits
            **Secure access**: OAuth provides applications with secure access to a user's data and resources. 
            **One-click logins**: OAuth allows users to identify themselves to a web service without having to enter their username and password every time. 
            .
           **Easy revocation of access**: Users can quickly and easily revoke access from third-party applications. 
            .
           **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: OAuth 2.0 enables SSO capabilities, allowing users to sign in to multiple services with a single set of credentials.
