**SDLC**: 
    - SDLC is a step-by-step guide for developing systems or software applications. Think of it as a recipe: before cooking a meal, you need a recipe to guide the process.

Phases of SDLC:
    1) **Requirement Gathering & Analysis** - 
        The first step is to understand what the system needs to do. This phase involves talking to stakeholders (users, business teams, etc.) to gather their requirements.

.
    2) **System Design** - 
        Once the requirements are clear, the next step is to design the system. This includes two key components:
        High-Level Design (**HLD**): 
            A blueprint outlining the overall architecture of the system. This includes the flow of data, how components interact, and how the system will handle different user inputs.
.
        Low-Level Design (**LLD**): 
            More detailed designs focusing on specific components, like data structures, user interfaces, and APIs.

        Think of HLD like designing a houseâ€™s layout (number of rooms, where the stairs go) and LLD like designing the rooms (dimensions, furniture arrangement).

.
    3)  **Implementation** (Coding) - 
        In this phase, developers start writing the code based on the design. Best practices such as version control and maintaining good coding standards are important here to ensure the code is maintainable and reusable. The implementation phase is where the system begins to take shape, turning designs into a working application.
   . 
    4) **Testing** - 
        After the system is implemented, it must be tested to ensure it works as expected. Various types of testing are performed:Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Load Testing, User Acceptance Testing.
.
    5) **Deployment** - 
        Once the system passes all tests, it is deployed to the production environment. Depending on the system, deployment may be done in phases (rolling deployment) to monitor user feedback and make adjustments before fully rolling out.
  .  
    6) **Maintenance** - 
        Even after deployment, the system needs to be maintained. This phase involves fixing bugs, adding new features, and adapting the system to new technologies or environments.

        Maintenance is often divided into three categories:
            i) Corrective Maintenance: Fixing bugs and issues that arise after deployment.
            ii) Adaptive Maintenance: Updating the system to work with new technologies or platforms.
            iii) Perfective Maintenance: Adding new features or improving existing ones.
