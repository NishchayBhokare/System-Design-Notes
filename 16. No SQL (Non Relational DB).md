**NO SQL** (**Non Relational DB**):
    - It stands for Non-sql database or we can say that it is a non-relational database.
    - A **NoSQL** database is a database management system that **stores data** in a **non-tabular** format and uses other programming languages to query data.
    - The term NoSQL refers to data stores that do not use SQL for queries.




**No SQL is umbrella** comprising of four different types of databases.
    1) **Key Value DB**. 
        - A key-value store is a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values. Each key is unique and associated with a single value. 
        - **They are used for caching** and session management and provide high performance in reads and writes because they tend to store things in memory.
        - DB Examples are **Amazon DynamoDB and Redis**. 
        - Generally used for caching. one more eg. (in Ecard for price and their quantity)
    .
    2) **Document DB**: 
        - A document-oriented database **stores data in documents similar to JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values.
        - A document database offers a flexible data model, much suited for **semi-structured** and typically **unstructured data sets**. They also support nested structures, making it easy to represent complex relationships or hierarchical data.
        - eg-**MongoDB**
    .
    3) **Columnar DB**:
        - A columnar database is a type of database management system that **stores data in columns rather than rows**. eg(for machine learning purposes).
        -The columns are stored together instead of rows. Because of that, the aggregation in such databases is rapid. It is widely used for Data analysis.
        -eg- **Cassandra db**.
    .
    4) **Graph DB**:
        - Graph database represents and **stores entities and relationships in the form of graph** data structure. It is majorly used for social networks When your data is in the form of a graph like social networks we use this. eg(linkedin).


**Advantages**
    1) **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are popular for their scalability. 
    2) **Simplicity**: NoSQL databases are simpler and require less code. 
    3) **Easy maintenance**: NoSQL databases are easy to maintain. 


**Disadvantages**
    1) **Lack of standardization**: NoSQL databases don't have a standard query language or data model, making it difficult to integrate with other systems and migrate data. 
    .
    2) **Limited query capabilities**: NoSQL's query language isn't as powerful or established as SQL's, which can be a drawback for complex queries. 
    .
    3) **Consistency and ACID compliance**: Many NoSQL databases sacrifice strong consistency and ACID guarantees for better scalability and performance.
    . 
    4) **Data modeling complexity**: NoSQL databases are more complex to design, implement, and manage than SQL databases. 
    .
    5) **Eventual consistency**: NoSQL lacks ACID transactions, which guarantee reliable transactions.
