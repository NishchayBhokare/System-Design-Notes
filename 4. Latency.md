What is **Latency**?
    - It is the ability of network to provide **reponses** in **minimal delay**.
    - Latency equals to **Network Delay + Computational Delay**.
    - suppose user send request which takes time t1, then computation time at server end will be t2 and response time will be t3. then total latency 
    i.e **DeltaT (dt) = t1+t2+t3**.
    - In Monolithic system Latency is **low** comparitively Distributed System.
    - In **Monolithic** System Latency is = **Computational Delay**.
    - In **Distributed** System Latency is = **Computational Delay + Network Delay**.
    



Different Ways To Reduce Latency:
    - **Caching**: It is the process of storing information for a set period of time on a computer.
    - **CDN**:(Content Delivery Network) are **geographically distributed networks** of proxy servers & their objective is to serve content to users more quickly.
    - **Upgrading System**.


- **Low Latency is good**.
