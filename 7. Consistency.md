What is Consistency?
    - When more than one client requests to the system, for all such requests, it will be called consistent when each **client gets the same data**. The **data** should always be **consistent**, regardless of who is accessing it.
    .
    - In **Monolithic** architecture **consistency** is **more** comparitively **Distributed** architecture.


Factors improving Consistency:
    - **Improving network bandwidth**: Improve network speed.
    - **Stop the read** operation during updation processs.
    - **Replication** based on distance aware strategies.


Types of Consistency:
    - **Strong Consistency**: When the system doesn't allow read operation until all the nodes with replicated data are updated. eg. banking apps, booking website.
    .
    - **Eventual Consistency**: User read requests are not halted(not stopped) till all the replicas are updated are updated, rather the update process is eventual. Some users might receive old data but eventually all the data is updated to latest data. eg. social media app.
    .
    - **Weak Consistency**: Weak consistency does not guarantee when replicas will converge(or will gets update), in contrast to eventual consistency, which assures convergence(updation of nodes).



What is Dirty Read?
    - When more than one client requests to the system, for all such requests, when **different clients get different responese** due to some **recent update** that has not been committed to all systems yet, this reading operation will be called as **dirty read**.
