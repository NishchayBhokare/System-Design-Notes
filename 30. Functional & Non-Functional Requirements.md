 Functional Requirements:
    - Functional requirements define the features the system.
    - Functional requirements describe what the system must do. These requirements specify the features, functions, or tasks that the system should perform. They define the core operations of the system and are typically measurable and testable.

    For example, in an e-commerce website, functional requirements could include:
        a) The ability to search for products.
        b) The option to add items to the shopping cart.
        c) The ability to process payments via various payment gateways.
        d) Admins should be able to update product details.

 
Non-functional Requirements:
    - Non-functional requirements ensure those features perform well under real-world conditions.
    - Non-functional requirements focus on how well the system performs its functions.
    - Non-functional requirements address the quality of the system and the overall user experience. They cover aspects like performance, security, scalability, and usability.

    - For example, If the ecommerce website mentioned above allows you to search for a product, the non-functional requirement might specify that the search results should load within 3 seconds.
    - Security could specify that payment transactions must be encrypted.
    - Scalability could specify that the system should be able to handle 1 million users during peak hours without crashing.

    - Non-functional requirements are essential because they ensure that the system meets user expectations regarding its quality and performance

Requirement Gathering:
    - Requirements gathering is the process of understanding and documenting the needs and expectations of users, stakeholders, and other entities involved in the system's development. It's like creating a blueprint for the system before development begins. The key goal is to ensure that you are building a system that solves the right problems and serves the correct functions.
    - There are two main types of requirements: 
        Functional requirements.
        Non-functional requirements.

    - Techniques for Gathering Requirements - Interviews, Workshops,  Surveys or Questionnaires, Observation, Prototyping, Use Case Analysis.
