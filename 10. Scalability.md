What is Scalability?
    - Scalability refers to the **ability** of a system to **handle increasing amounts** of workload or requests **without sacrificing performance or incurring excessive costs**.


** There are two main types of scalability: **Vertical scaling(Scale-up)** and **Horizontal scaling(Scale-out)**.


1) **Vertical Scaling**:
    - Vertical scaling, also known as **scaling up**, refers to the **process of increasing the capacity** or capabilities of an individual **hardware** or **software** component within a system.
    - we can add **more power** to our machine by **adding better processors**, **increasing RAM**, or **other power-increasing adjustments**.

Advantages:
    - **Easy Implementation**.
    - **Management is easy**.
    - **consume less power**.

Disadvantages:
    - **Limited Scalability**: We can scalable machine at one limit. Every machine has their physical limitataion.
    - **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)** - Single point of failure is those point where the entire system can crash if that one single point fail.
    - **Increased cost**: Initially simpler, but can become costlier long-term. It may be more costly to upgrade a serverâ€™s hardware than to add extra nodes.




2) **Horizontal Scaling**:
    - Horizontal scaling, also known as **scaling out**, refers to the process of **increasing the capacity** or performance of a system **by adding more machines or servers** to **distribute** the **workload** across a larger number of individual units.
    - In this approach, there is no need to change the capacity of the server or replace the server.
    - Also, like vertical scaling, there is **no downtime** while adding more servers to the network.

Advantages:
    - **Increased fault tolerance**: Incoming requests can be sent to another node in the event of a node failure, lowering the possibility of downtime.
    - **Improved performance**: By distributing the load over several nodes or instances, it is less likely that any one server will get overloaded.
    - **Increased capacity**: More nodes or instances can handle a larger number of incoming requests.


Disadvantages: 
    - **Increased complexity**: Managing multiple nodes or instances can be more complex than managing a single node.
    - **Consume more power**.
    - **Complex Implementation**.
    - **Increased cost**: Adding more nodes or instances will typically increase the cost of the system.
