**Synchronous Communication(Blocking call)**:
    - when one **sender/service sends a request and waits for a response** before moving on then it's called as Synchronous communication.
    .
    - It used to **achieve high consistency**. 
    - for eg. In **Bank payements**, **Stock Market**, **Ticket Booking**, **Real Time Decision Making**, **when we add product into the cart on amazon**.


Advantages:
    1) **Immediate** **feedback** and interaction.
    2) Encourages clearer and faster decision-making.
    3) **Clearer communication**: Fewer things get lost in translation when speaking to colleagues in real time. 

Disadvantages:
    1) Requires all parties/**resources** to be **available** at the same time.
    2) Can **lead to interruptions and be time-consuming**.



**Asynchronous Communication (Non-blocking call)**:
    - When **sender sends a request and continues its execution without waiting** for an immediate response.
    - Once the response is ready, it can be delivered via callbacks, message queues, or event-driven mechanisms.
    - Asynchronous communication is commonly **used** in **distributed systems**, **microservices**, and **applications requiring high scalability and flexibility**.
    - It **reduces latency** and **improves system performance by decoupling the sender and receiver**, though it may **add complexity in managing responses**.
    - It's a **useful** way **to coordinate independent parts** of a system.
    .
    - One of the best **examples** of an asynchronous system is **email**. When you send an email, it gets routed through various servers until it reaches its destination. During this time, you're free to perform other tasks — write more emails, organize your folders, etc. 

When It is used
    - When **computation takes a lot of time**.
    - **Scalability** of application.
    - Avoid **Cascading failure**.


Advantages
    1) **Flexibility** – people can respond at their convenience.
    2) **Reduces pressure for instant replies**, allowing more thoughtful responses.
    3) **Better time management.**

Disadvantages
    1) **Slower communication process**.
    2) **May lead to misunderstandings** or delays in decision-making.
    3) **Misinterpretations**: The lack of immediate feedback can sometimes lead to misinterpretations
