What is **Distributed System**.
    - All Modules are **ditributed** over the system.
    - A Distributed System is **collection** of **multiple indivisual systems** connected through a **network** that shares **resources**, **communicate** & **coordinate** to achieve common goals.
    - It is also know as **Microservices Architecture**.


**Advantages**
    - **Scalable**: In distributed System we can add more machine as per need. Horizontal scaling.
    - **No SPOF**(Single Point Of Failure) as system is distributed and not dependent on single machine.
    i.e System crash on one server does not affect on other servers.
    - **Low Latency**: In Distributed system, It is the ability of network to provide reponses in minimal delay.


**Disadvantages**
    - **Complexity**: Distributed System are more complex than Centralised System.
    - **Management**: More efforts required for System Management.
    - **Security**: As system is distributed, It's very challenging to secure whole system.
    - The **message** may be **lost** in between the nodes.
